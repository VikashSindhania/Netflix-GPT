// By using a ref, you ensure that:

// You can store information between re-renders (unlike regular variables, which reset on every render).
// Changing it does not trigger a re-render (unlike state variables, which trigger a re-render).
// The information is local to each copy of your component (unlike the variables outside, which are shared).

//useRef is a React Hook that lets you reference a value thatâ€™s not needed for rendering.
